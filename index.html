                I've spent the last few years working on large web applications where performance,
                state management, and maintainability actually matter. Lately, I've also been
                integrating AI-powered features into real production UIs.

            <h2>What I Work On</h2>
            <p>
                Most of my work sits at the intersection of frontend architecture and product engineering.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Breaking down large Angular apps so they stay maintainable as teams grow</li>
                <li>Making UI state predictable when the product gets complex</li>
                <li>Fixing performance issues that only show up at scale</li>
                <li>Turning experimental AI ideas into usable, reliable UI features</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Things I've Built Recently</h2>

            <h3>Enterprise Angular Applications</h3>
            <p>
                At Capgemini, I work on enterprise-scale Angular applications used by internal
                and external users.
            </p>

            <div class="callout">
                <strong>The app felt slow on first load</strong>
                <p>Introduced Angular Universal (SSR) and reworked the loading flow.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="callout">
                <strong>UI state was hard to reason about</strong>
                <p>Structured the app around NgRx and feature-level state stores.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="callout">
                <strong>New features kept breaking old ones</strong>
                <p>Tightened component boundaries and improved test coverage.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>GenAI Projects</h3>
            <p>
                Built RAG-based UI systems for contract analysis and audit intelligence,
                integrating semantic search and LLM-powered features into Angular dashboards.
            </p>

            <h2>How I Like to Build Frontend Systems</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep components small and boring</li>
                <li>Make data flow obvious</li>
                <li>Prefer predictability over cleverness</li>
                <li>Optimize performance only when it actually matters</li>
                <li>Write code so the next engineer understands it in 6 months</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Let's Talk</h2>
            <p>
                If you're working on complex frontend systems, performance problems,
                or practical AI in products — I'd love to chat.
